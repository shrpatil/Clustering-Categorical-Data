Algorithmic Description Of Methods 

A . Robust K-means for sequences  
Input: Categorical dataset and initial value of cluster k;
Output: The set of resulting clusters C being the number of nonnoise clusters. 
Begin
       1. Convert the categorical dataset into binary dataset using latine-1 encoding method
       2. Apply the PCA algorithm on binary data set plant_df .
       3. Let q be the number of iterations , q=0. Denote the initial clustering of  S by C(0) = ø;
       4. Let K  be the number of resulting clusters,  K= Ḱ ;
       5. Repeat
              5.1 q=q+1 ;
              5.2 Generate K  clusters by assigning each element in dataset to its nearby cluster.
                     Denote the new clustering by  C(q) ;
              5.3 Remove K- Dependent noise from  C(q) by calling the  Noise Detection Algorithm 
                    and update the number of cluster   K = | C(q) |.
              5.4 Recompute the centroid for each cluster in V  by averaging the vectors belonging 
                    to that cluster.
       until C(q) = C(q-1) ;
       6. Output C(q) ,

B. Noise Detection Routine
Input: C
Begin 
        1. Let   O = {Ck | Ck ϵ C and  nk = 1}. If O = ø then go to step 3.
        2. Otherwise, choose one cluster from O  and delete it from C  ; assign each object in   
             that cluster to its closest cluster and return;
        3. for each Ck  ϵ C  satisfying  nk  ≤ τ do
                3.1 Create C' by deleting Ck   from C  and assigning the objects in Ck to their 
                      respective closest cluster ;
                3.2  If  CVIc(C') ≤ CVIc(C) then replace C  with C' and return.
        End
